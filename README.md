**ExpenseTracker MCP Server**
ExpenseTracker is a FastMCP-based modular server for tracking and analyzing expenses. It exposes all core functionalities as tools that can be invoked by agents, clients, or other services, enabling automation and AI integration.
This project demonstrates a tool-oriented architecture (TOA) where each operation is a self-contained MCP tool, allowing flexible orchestration.
